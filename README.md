### Hi there. I am Apurve ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer.

I have been engineering ML piplelines and wrangling data since 2016. 

I love the process of training models, specially Transfer Learning ones, where one can use relatively small amount of data to get usefull results (in NLP). I have always been more enamoured by the products that use them.
For this reason the most of my work is in the form of closed source products live on some or other AWS instance. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building systems for keeping drivers and fleets safe, and on time at DriveBuddyAI
