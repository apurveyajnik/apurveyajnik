I am a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer. I am from a town called Meerut, in Uttar Pradesh, India. I have be engineering ML piplelines and wragling data since 2015. Although the I am love the process of training models, scpecially Deep Learning (or Transfer learning) models. I have always been more enamoured by the their final output or product that uses them, and it's effect on the world.
For this reason the most of my work is in form of closed source products live on some or other AWS instance.
