### Hi there. I am Apurve ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer. I am from a town called Meerut, in Uttar Pradesh, India. 
I have been engineering ML piplelines and wragling data since 2016. 

Although the I love the process of training models, specially Transfer Learning ones, where one can use relatively small amount of data to get usefull results (in NLP), I have always been more enamoured by the their final output, product that uses them, and it's effect on the world 
For this reason the most of my work is in the form of closed source products live on some or other AWS instance. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building systems for keeping drivers and fleets safe, and on time at DriveBuddyAI
- âš¡ No so fun fact: According to WHO approximatly 1.3 Million people die of road traffic accidents each year.
